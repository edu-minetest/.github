Make education easily accessible and free for everyone.

## Welcome to Minetest: Education Edition!ðŸ‘‹

This project was developed from the idea of using a game as a way to enhance children's learning experiences. After discovering that Minecraft: Education Edition was only accessible to schools with larger budgets and limited access for individual users, we turned to the open-source [Minetest voxel game engine][minetest] as a more open and free alternative.

"[Minetest: Education Edition][minetest-edu]" is an interactive educational world application based on the open-source voxel game engine, [Minetest][minetest].

- [X] Separate play UI from play world management UI
- [X] Control play time and protect children's eyes
- [X] Insert practices while gaming
- [X] Single-player game support different users to use a shared computer
- [X] Built-in education-related mods (mathematics, automation, electronic circuits, programming, etc.) and some selected mods
- [ ] Write interactive educational world courses using approximate natural language text outside of the game(to be implemented)

We hope that by releasing this open-source project, more people can benefit from the learning opportunities presented by [Minetest: Education Edition][minetest-edu].
