Make education easily accessible and free for everyone.

## Welcome to Minetest: Education Edition!

This project was developed from the idea of using a game as a way to enhance children's learning experiences. After discovering that Minecraft: Education Edition was only accessible to schools with larger budgets and limited access for individual users, we turned to the open-source [Minetest voxel game engine][minetest] as a more open and free alternative.

"[Minetest: Education Edition](https://edu.ihom.net)" is an interactive educational world application based on the open-source voxel game engine, [Minetest][minetest].
